# Overview

This project is a fully interactive To-Do List web application built using JavaScript. The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of modern JavaScript concepts by building a complete, browser-based app that goes beyond static web pages. It includes interactive features such as dynamic DOM manipulation, drag-and-drop functionality, recursion for nested data, and error handling.

As a software engineer in training, my purpose for writing this software was to explore the core capabilities of JavaScript as a language — including its syntax, event-driven nature, and built-in array functions. I also wanted to practice integrating third-party libraries and writing clean, modular, and maintainable front-end code.
